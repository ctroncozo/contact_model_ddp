# Trajectory Optimization With Implicit Hard Contacts
<p>
Paper Reference: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8403260

* Use the technique from the paper reference to optimize gait sequence, timing, and whole-body motion by delegating the contact constraints to the system dynamics. 

* The method attempts to incorporate the complementary constraints into the OC problem. This approach is capable of finding dynamic movements without specifying the contact sequence.

#### Goal of this implementation:
* Cocroddyl already implements the contact model:
